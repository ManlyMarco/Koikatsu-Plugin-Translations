# Koikatsu Plugin Translations
English translations for various Japanese plugins

## Installation
1. Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)
2. Install [BepisPlugins](http://bepisbuilds.dyn.mk/bepis_plugins) Bleeding Edge build 166. These translations require Regex support which doesn't work in the official r6 release as well as methods for hooking GUIs that don't exist in r6.
3. Click the green "Clone or download" button above and "Download .zip". Extract and merge the BepInEx folder with your own.

## Notes
-These translations are a work in progress and their format may change as a result of ongoing changes to the DynamicTranslationLoader plugin.  
-Bleeding edge builds of BepisPlugins may contain bugs. Use at your own risk. Build 166 seems stable but no promises that other builds will work as well or at all.  
-These translations are made by someone with limited Japanese knowledge with the help of existing translations and Google Translate. They should at least be better than nothing.
